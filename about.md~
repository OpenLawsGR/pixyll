My name is Konstantinos Plessas and I am a postgraduate student following the Computer Science and Technology postraduate programme at the [Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics](http://www.ceid.upatras.gr), University of Patras, Greece.

OpenLaws.gr is a project I started while working for my Master thesis, entitled "Version Control Systems for Automated Management of Legal Documents", in order to share updates on our research results with the community. My supervisor is Prof. [John Garofalakis](http://athos.cti.gr/garofalakis).

As in most countries, the Greek legislative system publishes laws as documents often containing many references to precedent laws. Modifications to laws are published as text in legislative documents describing the applied changes. During its evolution cycle, a law may get modified several times (sometimes dozens of times), while these modifications may reside in many different scattered documents. As a result, the assembly of all relevant modifications in order to consolidate the current version of a law may prove to be a tedious work when performed manually, requiring an increased cognitive effort.

In the framework of this thesis, we are working on the application of natural language processing techniques for the automatic consolidation of Greek law documents and their publishing through version control systems.

We intend to publish Greek law texts on [Github](https://github.com/OpenLawsGR), along with our software's source code, in an effort to open Greek legislation to citizens!
