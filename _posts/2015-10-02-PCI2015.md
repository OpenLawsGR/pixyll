Today, it was the last day of the [19th Panhellenic Conference on Informatics (PCI 2015)](http://pci2015.teiath.gr), which was held in Athens from 1-3 October 2015. In this conference we had the chance to discuss some initial results of our work in progress and especially some of the problems that we are facing, as (as announced in a [previous post](http://www.openlaws.gr/publications/2015/06/29/PCI2015/)) we were presenting a short paper entitled "Automated Analysis of Greek Legislative Texts for Version Control: Limitations, Caveats and Challenges".

The audience seemed to be as excited as we are on this work, which we believe it is an encouraging indicator of the importance of this project not only for the scientific community, but also for the general public.

The originally submitted full paper that we were asked to transform to a short paper can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y9mc9f8d1va68nj/Automated%20Analysis%20of%20Greek%20Legislative%20Texts%20for%20Version%20Control%20Limitations%2C%20Caveats%20and%20Challenges.pdf?dl=0).
