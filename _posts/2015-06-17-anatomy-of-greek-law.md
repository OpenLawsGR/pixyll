Greek laws are published by the [National Printing Service](http://www.et.gr) as texts contained in issues of the Journal of the Greek Government. These issues are actually pdf files.

Law texts within an issue contain references to parts (e.g. articles, paragraphs etc.) of other issues. The reader should manage these references by himself as there are no links leading to the referenced content: search and download the appropriate pdf files and scan them to locate the content.

Law modifications (additions, deletions, insertions, updates) are verbally described. For example consider the following phrase from a Greek law:

> Article 19 of law 3429/2005 (issue 314 A) is substituted as follows: "..."

In such a case, the reader should find the text of law 3429/2005, locate article 19 and substitute its content with the new one. Usually, such modifications of a law's text reside in many different issues, while it is possible that the same part of a law is modified several times through its lifecycle
