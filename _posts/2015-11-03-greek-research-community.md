In this post, we briefly review some research efforts related to legal text analysis from the Greek research community. Unfortunately, natural language processing of Greek legal texts seems to be a domain with only limited activity.

One researcher active in this area is [Charalampos Tsimpouris] (http://www.wcl.ece.upatras.gr/el/ai/people/charalampos-tsimpouris), who is a Phd student at the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering of the University of Patras. He has published a paper entitled ["Acronym identification in Greek legal texts"] (http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqu009). The algorithm for the identification of the acronyms is described (in Greek language) [here] (https://sites.google.com/site/acronymrecognition/pattern-matching-algorithms/acronym-identification-in-greek-legal-texts). A Greek version of this paper can also be found [here] (http://www.eleto.gr/download/Conferences/9th%20Conference/Papers-and-speakers/9th_26-21-20-TsimpourisCharalampos-SgarbasKyriakos_Paper_V04.pdf). Moreover, he has submitted another paper entitled ["Automatic Classification of Greek Legal Documents"] (http://www.wcl.ece.upatras.gr/el/node/712), which is not however yet published. Finally, one can visit his [github account] (https://github.com/xtsimpouris), where, among others, there is a [sentence segmenter] (https://github.com/xtsimpouris/gr-nlp-law) for the python natural language processing tool NLTK, trained from a Greek legal corpus.

Another researcher active in this field is [Ilias Chalkidis] (https://gr.linkedin.com/in/iliaschalkidis), who is an MsC student and research associate at National & Kapodistrian University of Athens. His undergraduate [thesis]  (https://www.dropbox.com/s/zle8mqlm6yyxooi/thesis.pdf?dl=0) was about a platform where Greek legislation can be published in a machine readable format and as linked data. The [original platform] (http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~std07122/index) was improved and is now available [here] (http://legislation.di.uoa.gr/). The source code (including a legal parser) is available in [github] (https://github.com/KiddoTheGreek). His relevant publications include a paper published in a student conference entitled "Modeling and Querying Greek Legislation using Semantic Web Technologies" (the presentation can be found [here] (http://www.slideshare.net/ihalk/modeling-and-querying-greek-legislation-using-semantic-web-technologies-48162244)).


Finally, [Marios Koniaris] (http://www.dbnet.ntua.gr/~mkoniari/), a Phd student at the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens, has published two papers, although not related to the Greek legislation, but to that of the European Union. The first one is under the title ["Legislation as a complex network: Modelling and analysis over the European Union law"] (http://www.dbnet.ntua.gr/~mkoniari/docs/jurix14.pdf), while the second under the title ["Network Analysis in the Legal Domain: A complex model for European Union legal sources"] (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.05237.pdf).
